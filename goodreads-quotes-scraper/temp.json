["\u201cI'm selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am out of control and at times hard to handle. But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best.\u201d -- Marilyn Monroe", "\u201cYou've gotta dance like there's nobody watching,Love like you'll never be hurt,Sing like there's nobody listening,And live like it's heaven on earth.\u201d -- William W. Purkey", "\u201cYou know you're in love when you can't fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams.\u201d -- Dr. Seuss", "\u201cA friend is someone who knows all about you and still loves you.\u201d -- Elbert Hubbard", "\u201cDarkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that.\u201d -- Martin Luther King Jr.,", "\u201cWe accept the love we think we deserve.\u201d -- Stephen Chbosky,", "\u201cOnly once in your life, I truly believe, you find someone who can completely turn your world around. You tell them things that you\u2019ve never shared with another soul and they absorb everything you say and actually want to hear more. You share hopes for the future, dreams that will never come true, goals that were never achieved and the many disappointments life has thrown at you. When something wonderful happens, you can\u2019t wait to tell them about it, knowing they will share in your excitement. They are not embarrassed to cry with you when you are hurting or laugh with you when you make a fool of yourself. Never do they hurt your feelings or make you feel like you are not good enough, but rather they build you up and show you the things about yourself that make you special and even beautiful. There is never any pressure, jealousy or competition but only a quiet calmness when they are around. You can be yourself and not worry about what they will think of you because they love you for who you are. The things that seem insignificant to most people such as a note, song or walk become invaluable treasures kept safe in your heart to cherish forever. Memories of your childhood come back and are so clear and vivid it\u2019s like being young again. Colours seem brighter and more brilliant. Laughter seems part of daily life where before it was infrequent or didn\u2019t exist at all. A phone call or two during the day helps to get you through a long day\u2019s work and always brings a smile to your face. In their presence, there\u2019s no need for continuous conversation, but you find you\u2019re quite content in just having them nearby. Things that never interested you before become fascinating because you know they are important to this person who is so special to you. You think of this person on every occasion and in everything you do. Simple things bring them to mind like a pale blue sky, gentle wind or even a storm cloud on the horizon. You open your heart knowing that there\u2019s a chance it may be broken one day and in opening your heart, you experience a love and joy that you never dreamed possible. You find that being vulnerable is the only way to allow your heart to feel true pleasure that\u2019s so real it scares you. You find strength in knowing you have a true friend and possibly a soul mate who will remain loyal to the end. Life seems completely different, exciting and worthwhile. Your only hope and security is in knowing that they are a part of your life.\u201d -- Bob Marley", "\u201cIt is better to be hated for what you are than to be loved for what you are not.\u201d -- Andr\u00e9 Gide,", "\u201cAs he read, I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once.\u201d -- John Green,", "\u201cThe opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference. The opposite of art is not ugliness, it's indifference. The opposite of faith is not heresy, it's indifference. And the opposite of life is not death, it's indifference.\u201d -- Elie Wiesel", "\u201cIt is not a lack of love, but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages.\u201d -- Friedrich Nietzsche", "\u201cI love you without knowing how, or when, or from where. I love you simply, without problems or pride: I love you in this way because I do not know any other way of loving but this, in which there is no I or you, so intimate that your hand upon my chest is my hand, so intimate that when I fall asleep your eyes close.\u201d -- Pablo Neruda,", "\u201cLove all, trust a few, do wrong to none.\u201d -- William Shakespeare,", "\u201cHave you ever been in love? Horrible isn't it? It makes you so vulnerable. It opens your chest and it opens up your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up.\u201d -- Neil Gaiman,", "\u201cBeing deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage.\u201d -- Lao Tzu", "\u201cThis life is what you make it. No matter what, you're going to mess up sometimes, it's a universal truth. But the good part is you get to decide how you're going to mess it up. Girls will be your friends - they'll act like it anyway. But just remember, some come, some go. The ones that stay with you through everything - they're your true best friends. Don't let go of them. Also remember, sisters make the best friends in the world. As for lovers, well, they'll come and go too. And baby, I hate to say it, most of them - actually pretty much all of them are going to break your heart, but you can't give up because if you give up, you'll never find your soulmate. You'll never find that half who makes you whole and that goes for everything. Just because you fail once, doesn't mean you're gonna fail at everything. Keep trying, hold on, and always, always, always believe in yourself, because if you don't, then who will, sweetie? So keep your head high, keep your chin up, and most importantly, keep smiling, because life's a beautiful thing and there's so much to smile about.\u201d -- Marilyn Monroe", "\u201cThere is never a time or place for true love. It happens accidentally, in a heartbeat, in a single flashing, throbbing moment.\u201d -- Sarah Dessen,", "\u201cLove is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own.\u201d -- Robert A.

But if she loves you now, what else matters? She's not perfect\u2014you aren't either, and the two of you may never be perfect together but if she can make you laugh, cause you to think twice, and admit to being human and making mistakes, hold onto her and give her the most you can. She may not be thinking about you every second of the day, but she will give you a part of her that she knows you can break\u2014her heart. So don't hurt her, don't change her, don't analyze and don't expect more than she can give. Smile when she makes you happy, let her know when she makes you mad, and miss her when she's not there.\u201d -- Bob Marley", "\u201cI am nothing special, of this I am sure. I am a common man with common thoughts and I've led a common life.

But a true soul mate is a mirror, the person who shows you everything that is holding you back, the person who brings you to your own attention so you can change your life. A true soul mate is probably the most important person you'll ever meet, because they tear down your walls and smack you awake. But to live with a soul mate forever? Nah. Too painful. Soul mates, they come into your life just to reveal another layer of yourself to you, and then leave. A soul mates purpose is to shake you up, tear apart your ego a little bit, show you your obstacles and addictions, break your heart open so new light can get in, make you so desperate and out of control that you have to transform your life, then introduce you to your spiritual master...\u201d -- Elizabeth Gilbert,", "\u201cIf you can make a woman laugh, you can make her do anything.\u201d -- Marilyn Monroe", "\u201cYou don't love someone because they're perfect, you love them in spite of the fact that they're not.\u201d -- Jodi Picoult,", "\u201cWe\u2019re all a little weird.
